# tableturn

Generate random sorting of a sentence given

I named it tableturn as a reference to a joke made by **Micheal Scott** from the **The Office**.

The joke is that he's mixing up the expression 'How the tables have turned' to 'How the turntables'.

I set the limit of words to 9 because i can.

Usage:
```zsh
~ ./turntable "your sentence"
```
